Leaflet Javascript page for displaying GIS data in GeoJSON format

You can create a suitable GeoJSON file by exporting it from QGIS in GeoJSON format. Use WGS84 geographic as coordinate system. The color of the feature is determined by an attribute column named color, with the desired color given in hex format (e.g. #ff0000 for red) or rgb(255,0,0) notation. You need to edit line 89 to add new/different data sets.
